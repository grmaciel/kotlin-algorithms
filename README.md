## Problems solved:

** Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. ** 

** Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s. ** <br>

** Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1. ** <br>

** Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. For example, "Red rum, sir, is murder" is a palindrome, while "Programcreek is awesome" is not. **<br>
